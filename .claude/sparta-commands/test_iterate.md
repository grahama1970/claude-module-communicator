# Run tests critically, analyze results, and iterate on failures.

Run tests critically, analyze results, and iterate on failures.
    
    This command implements the critical test validation workflow:
    1. Runs pytest with JSON and Allure reporting
    2. Analyzes results with zero tolerance for failures
    3. Attempts automated fixes for common issues
    4. Re-runs tests after fixes
    5. Generates comprehensive reports

## Usage

```bash
python test_iterate $ARGUMENTS
```

## Examples

```bash
# In Claude Code:
/project:test_iterate [arguments]
```
